# Pulse Nexus

> Built by **Faith Based Innovations**

An iPhone app that combines **Apple Health**, **WHOOP**, **Fitbit** (including
the new Google-era Fitbits and Pixel Watch), and **Garmin** data into one
customizable view, with a deterministic rule-based dashboard and a multi-turn
Coach chat that can run on **Google Gemini**, **OpenAI ChatGPT**, **Anthropic
Claude**, or **xAI Grok**.

Pulse Nexus also hands your data off to the **external ChatGPT iOS app** (and
Claude / Grok) in two complementary ways:

1. **Share-Sheet path (works for everyone, no infrastructure):** every Home /
   Sleep / Workouts tab has an "Ask…" button that opens the ChatGPT, Claude,
   or Grok app with a plain-text snapshot of that tab's data already in the
   prompt box. See [`lib/share.ts`](./lib/share.ts) and
   [`components/AskExternalAI.tsx`](./components/AskExternalAI.tsx).
2. **Custom-GPT path (true pull, requires a free Cloudflare deploy):** the
   sister project [`pulse-nexus-connector/`](../pulse-nexus-connector/)
   exposes your WHOOP / Fitbit / Garmin data over HTTPS so a ChatGPT Custom
   GPT can call `getSnapshot`, `getLastNightSleep`, `getRecentWorkouts`
   whenever you ask it a question. See that folder's README for the
   deployment + GPT-creation walkthrough.

## The five tabs

| Tab | What it does | Engine | Disclaimer? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Home** | Customizable metric cards + rule-based insights pulled from all connected sources | Deterministic rules in `lib/assistant.ts` (no model) | No — auditable in source |
| **Sleep** | Last night with full stage breakdown (Deep / REM / Light / Awake), efficiency, score, debt, respiration | `lib/sleep.ts` (no model) | No |
| **Workouts** | Newest-first list of workouts merged from all four sources; filter by source and time window | `lib/workouts.ts` (no model) | No |
| **Coach** | Multi-turn chat that knows your current data and can search the web | **User-selected provider** (Gemini / ChatGPT / Claude / Grok), with a deterministic health-context system prompt | Yes — persistent banner |
| **Settings** | About + entry points for Connect devices and Preferences | — | — |

Plus two stack-pushed screens:

- **Connect devices** — WHOOP / Fitbit / Garmin OAuth
- **Preferences** — Pick Coach engine, toggle which Home cards show, choose metric/imperial units

## Customizable Coach: Gemini / ChatGPT / Claude / Grok

Each provider runs through a common interface (`lib/ai/types.ts`). The Coach
screen reads the active provider from Preferences and uses it for every turn.
Each provider has its own API key in `.env`; missing keys disable that
provider with a clear in-app message.

| Provider | Vendor | Default model | Web search | Cost | Key URL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gemini** | Google | `gemini-2.0-flash` | ✓ Google Search grounding | Free tier | aistudio.google.com/app/apikey |
| **ChatGPT** | OpenAI | `gpt-4o-mini` | Off (enable via tools in code) | Paid | platform.openai.com/api-keys |
| **Claude** | Anthropic | `claude-3-5-haiku-latest` | Off (enable via tools in code) | Paid | console.anthropic.com/settings/keys |
| **Grok** | xAI | `grok-2-latest` | ✓ Live search | Paid (SuperGrok credits available) | console.x.ai/ |

Override any default model by setting the corresponding `EXPO_PUBLIC_*_MODEL`
env var. The user-facing disclaimer banner is on for the Coach tab regardless
of provider.

> Anthropic's API historically does not allow direct browser-origin calls.
> The Claude provider sends `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true`
> per Anthropic's documented opt-in. If Anthropic later requires a server
> intermediary, route only `lib/ai/anthropic.ts` through a thin proxy
> (Cloudflare Worker / Vercel Function) and keep the rest of the app
> client-side.

## First-time setup

```bash
cd pulse-nexus-app
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill .env. At minimum, set ONE of the AI provider keys.
```

### Register OAuth redirect URIs

| Provider | Redirect URI |
|---|---|
| WHOOP | `pulsenexus://whoop-callback` |
| Fitbit | `pulsenexus://fitbit-callback` |
| Garmin | `pulsenexus://garmin-callback` |

## Run the app locally

```bash
npm start           # Expo dev server
npm run ios         # build & run on an iOS simulator / device
```

## Cross-source unification

| Metric | Priority |
|---|---|
| Recovery | WHOOP → fallback to Garmin Body Battery |
| Resting HR / HRV | WHOOP → Garmin → Fitbit → Apple Health |
| Sleep hours / sleep snapshot | WHOOP → Garmin → Fitbit → Apple Health |
| Steps / Active kcal | Garmin → Fitbit → Apple Health |
| SpO₂ | Fitbit → Apple Health |
| Strain (0–21) | WHOOP only |
| Body Battery / Stress | Garmin only |

Disagreement thresholds in `disagreement()` in `lib/assistant.ts`.

## Roadmap — "everything modern apps have"

Already shipped:

- ✅ Dashboard with rule-based, source-attributed insights
- ✅ Customizable metric cards
- ✅ Sleep detail with stages, efficiency, score, debt, per-device compare
- ✅ Unified workouts list with filters and totals
- ✅ Multi-provider Coach chat (Gemini / ChatGPT / Claude / Grok)
- ✅ "Ask ChatGPT / Claude / Grok" share button on every tab — sends the
   current snapshot straight into the external AI app's prompt box
- ✅ Custom-GPT connector backend (Cloudflare Worker) — see
   [`../pulse-nexus-connector/`](../pulse-nexus-connector/)
- ✅ Keychain-backed token + preference storage
- ✅ Persistent AI disclaimer banner

Designed for, not yet built:

- ⏳ Long-window trends — 7 / 30 / 90 day sparklines for HRV, RHR, recovery, sleep
- ⏳ Mindfulness / breathing — guided sessions, with reads from Apple Health Mindful Minutes
- ⏳ Hydration & nutrition logging (would integrate with Apple Health water + caffeine + dietary energy)
- ⏳ Menstrual cycle tracking (Apple Health Cycle Tracking + Fitbit / Garmin equivalents)
- ⏳ Body composition (weight, BMI, body-fat %, waist) merged from Withings / Garmin Index / Fitbit Aria / Apple Health
- ⏳ Apple Watch companion app (so the watch face can talk to Pulse Nexus directly)
- ⏳ Home Screen + Lock Screen widgets via WidgetKit
- ⏳ Live Activities for in-progress workouts
- ⏳ Trend exports (CSV / JSON) for users who want their data
- ⏳ Optional cloud sync (would require a server)

The dashboard insight engine and unified data model are already designed to
absorb any new metric — add a field to `CombinedSnapshot` in `lib/assistant.ts`
and a rule in `generateInsights()`, then surface it on the relevant tab.
